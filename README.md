# Stage_M1
This repository contains some codes in relation with the phi-FEM. These codes were developped during my internship in the MIMESIS team, at INRIA (Nancy Grand-Est).

The different codes are made using `FEniCS` and `multiphenics` to compute the FEM. To watch the plots that are made in some programms, you should also turn on `vedo` (easy install using pip). 
You can find two types of codes : 
1. Some codes about the implementation of the phi-fem for different cases (Dirichlet conditions, Neumann conditions, linear elasticity, etc);
2. Some codes about the creation of the function phi for 2D and 3D cases from a scatterplot using different forms created with 'mshr'.
