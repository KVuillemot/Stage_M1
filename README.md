# Stage_M1
This repository contains some codes in relation with phi-FEM. These codes were developped during my internship in the MIMESIS team.

The different codes are made using `FEniCS` and `multiphenics` to compute the FEM.

You can find two types of codes : 
1. Some codes about the implementation of phi-fem for different cases (Dirichlet conditions, Neumann conditions, linear elasticity, etc);
2. Some codes about the creation of the function phi for 2D cases from a scatterplot using different shapes created with 'mshr'.
 
Here is also the manuscript written during the internship, in french.
